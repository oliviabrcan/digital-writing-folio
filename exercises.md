# Week 1
## Intial Thoughts - (3/3/25)
I am looking forward to learning how to digital write and use the programs supplied. Playing with format will be very interesting to learn and see where it takes my writing.

After setting up GitHub, I am thoroughly confused. However, I love how organised and structured the site is. Everything has a spot and you can create file after file to separate everything which I appreciate. Although the coding itself is confusing, I think it will be quick to pick up once I understand what everything means and does.
  
# Week 3
## Reflection - (17/3/25)

- How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?

I feel extremely confused. I know what we're supposed to be doing but I don't actually KNOW. Everything has a meaning that I actually have no idea what they mean.

- Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?

I don't read e-lit, but I understand that everything we see has a code that someone has written out.

## Algorithm and Constraint
### Lipograms
Rewrite a short piece of writing without the following letters: b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, p, q, t, and y.

The white shirt under his suit ignites to a fluorescent blue as he scurries across the vibrant dance floor to the golden lit bar. He tucks his arms into his body as a large, rowdy group position themselves on top of him. A few of them lean over the bar, no doubt to steady themselves from a swirling mind, effectively blocking his view to the left side of the bar.

# Week 5
## Proposals discussion and reflections - (2/4/25)

- What is emerging for you in terms of your own piece toward Assessment 2 and 3?

I would like to create an interactive fiction piece. I'm more confident writing fiction and really like the idea of giving readers agency when it comes to the narrative. Being able to explore different options and pathways is super interesting and something I've never done before, but something I would like to do for my folio piece.

- What platform and technology does it require?

I'm thinking Twine will be the best option for me.

- Do you know already if you can make it?

I cannot already make it. I am not familiar enough with Twine or any other platform to start anything.

- What else do you need to learn in order to execute your vision for this piece?

I need to gain a lot more skills and knowledge on Twine before I can start anything as I currently barely know anything. The most I can do right now to organise my folio piece is to plan out the story.

## Aarseth's Reading

- What do you think of Aarseth's concept? Explain how it offers an alternative to conventional ideas of narrative and the role of reader and writer?

Aarseth’s ideas and concepts were all things I hadn’t thought about that deeply and informed me to new ways of thinking. Many things were discussed, but one of the first points raised was the question of where hypertexts and electronic literature in general belong. Unlike physical books, it cannot be reproduced for consumers and will always belong to the platform it was published on and the author themselves. People can’t buy their own copy and keep it on a bookshelf and even though that’s obvious now that I read about it, it’s crazy to think about this idea of belonging, and how not all literature has that option. Additionally, it feels like the reader is just passing by, never sticking around after reading the piece. Whereas with a physical book, they read it and keep it close by, probably also somewhere on display like a bookshelf.

Referring to the narrative and roles of the writer and readers, there’s a lot of separation. Narrative isn’t always part of a hypertext, and the writer always has control over the text despite any interactivity because the writer created everything and just gave the options to the reader. Aarseth also mentions at one point that the writer can “change or add parts to the text, without any reader’s knowledge” (p. 81) which kind of feels like a betrayal. However, I do think that with electronic literature, specifically interactive fiction, the writer's text can’t function without a reader, therefore they must work together to see the piece as it should be seen.

# Week 6
## House on the Hill

- How does this work make you reflect on your own ideas and what you might do for your own piece? Requirement for final folio write 250 to 300 (minimum) words on this.

House on the Hill was very interesting to work through when considering how it was made, the interactivity, the plot, visuals, etc. It reminded me a lot of an old video game since the images were 2D and pixelated, same as the figure/main character that you played, and also alike the text typed into the textbox on the screen. Each room was made up of a few sahes of purple and the interactive elements were white so you knew where to move the character to. Arrows were drawn on the ground to guide you around the room as well, which was good because they were the only guiding factors in the entire piece. At the start, I didn't know how to move or play the game, it was a bit of pressing buttons on the keyboard until something happened which didn't take long becuase every button I pressed progressed the narration in the textbox.

I was able to move through the rooms in the house at my own pace and replay certain pieces however many times I wanted. It was cool how the story couldn't move without the player, and despite not having control over what the story was, they had control over how they were going to recieve the story and in what order. As you move throught he rooms it's like you level up and achieve more information about the haunted house and family secrets, unlocking characters and eventually leaving the house with knowledge you didn't have at the start.

In terms of my own writing, I don't think I will take much from this piece. Iwould rather my final piece to read more like interactive fiction rather than a video game, with less interactivity than 'House on the Hill'. Despite that difference, I do apreciate the narrative structure and how it progresses as the player moves through the game. The striking visuals also helped immerse me in the world created becuase I could see everything in the room, I could approach it and sometimes even interact with it. Although not to that level, including visuals that work with the story and maintain reader engagement is something really important and something I think will be vital in my own piece.

# Week 8 
## Reflection and Progress - (30/04/25)

### What has been introduced? 
-	Summarise your proposed piece

My piece follows one character through four different destinations of a dreamworld, and each destination will include a short story of a dream. However, the reader doesn’t know this is a dream world until the end, when it is revealed to them.

-	What themes and ideas is your piece exploring?

There will be themes of fear, the unknown, death, identity, and maybe power. Each short story will likely explore different themes.

-	What literary genre or style are you drawing on? Is it narrative-driven or more poetic and associative? Or essayistic?

This will be a fantasy piece, and the aesthetic will be whimsical and hazy to reflect the dreams. Colour will also be used to reflect the vibe of each story. For example, darker colours for more negative stages of the text and brighter colours for positivity.

-	What is the story? Or what do you want to express/communicate through this piece?

I want this to feel like a journey for the reader, that they’re following the character through these places on the map and experiencing good and bad things that reflect aspects of good dreams and nightmares. 

-	What do you wish the reader to understand or feel?

I’m not entirely sure what I want to express to the reader or what the ‘message’ will be, if I have any because I’m not certain what the short stories will be about. My main goal with the story is to include as many hints to dreams as possible to foreshadow the ending.

### What needs to be developed?
-	What drives the reader’s momentum through the piece?

The main momentum will be the ability to click through the main dream world map, which appears at the very beginning and after each short story. The reader's goal is to enter each destination on the map until they’ve all been read and the reveal at the end can occur. 

-	How does the digital feed into this momentum?

The digital is the momentum. It’s the reader’s ability to interact with the image map that moves the piece along.

-	How does the literary and the digital drive the momentum together with the piece’s thematics?


-	Do you need to develop the story/concept/narrative further in order to answer the above questions? How will you do this? By mapping? By writing it out?

Yes, I have a lot to develop. I don’t have specific ideas for each short story or what I want them to say to the piece. Once I know what I’m writing and what’s being included in the piece, I’ll have more of an idea of the themes and meaning I want to express to the reader. 
Brainstorming my ideas on a Word document is my plan to develop those ideas, so I can just get as many thoughts down and then decide where to put them and which ones I think will contribute the most to my idea.


### Scope and Scale

- How many words will it be?

Each short story will (potentially) be around 800-1000 words, so, about 4000 altogether. This could turn out to be lower as I think more about the story.

- How many screens?

There will be four short stories and then the map.

- What do you need to do on a week-by-week basis (is this realistic?)

Resolving the stories plots this week would be great so I can start writing as soon as possible. I would like to have these stories done by week 10.

- What is the tech that might get you stuck? what is the workaround/Plan B?

What I've planned to do so far on Twine sounds very doable, I don't think my ideas are too technical that I won't be able to achieve.
  
- What else might be an obstacle?

I think writing the short stories (dreams) might be one of the more difficutl tasks because I'm not sure how I want to structure them yet and there's four different plots I need to write.

# Week 9
## Reflection and Progress - (7/5/25)

### Write a summary and reflection on the feedback you recieved and a plan for the next few weeks
The plot I've planned out is solid and very structured becuase I didn't want to have too many branches of text sicne that's too much work for me and I don't have time to have multiple different outcomes. I want to have the entire plot written in a word doc by next Wednesday so I can jump into coding it in Twine.
