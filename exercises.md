# Week 1
## Intial Thoughts - (3/3/25)
I am looking forward to learning how to digital write and use the programs supplied. Playing with format will be very interesting to learn and see where it takes my writing.

After setting up GitHub, I am thoroughly confused. However, I love how organised and structured the site is. Everything has a spot and you can create file after file to separate everything which I appreciate. Although the coding itself is confusing, I think it will be quick to pick up once I understand what everything means and does.
  
# Week 3
## Reflection (17/3/25)
How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?
I feel extremely confused. I know what we're supposed to be doing but I don't actually KNOW. Everything has a meaning that I actually have no idea what they mean.

Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?
I don't read e-lit, but I understand that everything we see has a code that someone has written out for what we see.

The white shirt under his suit ignites to a fluorescent blue as he scurries across the vibrant dance floor to the golden lit bar. He tucks his arms into his body as a large, rowdy group position themselves on top of him. A few of them lean over the bar, no doubt to steady themselves from a swirling mind, effectively blocking his view to the left side of the bar.
