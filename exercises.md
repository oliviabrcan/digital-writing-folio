# Week 1
## Intial Thoughts - (3/3/25)
I am looking forward to learning how to digital write and use the programs supplied. Playing with format will be very interesting to learn and see where it takes my writing.

After setting up GitHub, I am thoroughly confused. However, I love how organised and structured the site is. Everything has a spot and you can create file after file to separate everything which I appreciate. Although the coding itself is confusing, I think it will be quick to pick up once I understand what everything means and does.
  
# Week 3
## Reflection (17/3/25)

- How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?

I feel extremely confused. I know what we're supposed to be doing but I don't actually KNOW. Everything has a meaning that I actually have no idea what they mean.

- Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?

I don't read e-lit, but I understand that everything we see has a code that someone has written out for what we see. 

## Algorithm and Constraint
### Lipograms
Rewrite a short piece of writing without the following letters: b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, p, q, t, and y.

The white shirt under his suit ignites to a fluorescent blue as he scurries across the vibrant dance floor to the golden lit bar. He tucks his arms into his body as a large, rowdy group position themselves on top of him. A few of them lean over the bar, no doubt to steady themselves from a swirling mind, effectively blocking his view to the left side of the bar.

# Week 5
## Proposals discussion and reflections (2/4/25)

- What is emerging for you in terms of your own piece toward Assessment 2 and 3?

I would like to create an interactive fiction piece. I'm more confident writing fiction and really like the idea of giving readers agency when it comes to the narrative. Being able to explore different options and pathways is super interesting and something I've never done before, but something I would like to do for my folio piece.

- What platform and technology does it require?

I'm thinking Twine will be the best option for me.

- Do you know already if you can make it?

I cannot already make it. I am not familiar enough with Twine or any other platform to start anything.

- What else do you need to learn in order to execute your vision for this piece?

I need to gain a lot more skills and knowledge on Twine before I can start anything as I currently barely know anything. The most I can do right now to organise my folio piece is to plan out the story.
