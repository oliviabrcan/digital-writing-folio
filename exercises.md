### Intial Thoughts - (3/3/25)
I am looking forward to learning how to digital write and use the programs supplied. Playing with format will be very interesting to learn and see where it takes my writing.

After setting up GitHub, I am thoroughly confused. However, I love how organised and structured the site is. Everything has a spot and you can create file after file to separate everything which I appreciate. Although the coding itself is confusing, I think it will be quick to pick up once I understand what everything means and does.
