### Reading Questions

Storyland (Nanette Wylde)
- What makes the work a piece of digital writing?

It was like an arcade game, I'm thinking of the one where you push a lever and the wheel spins until it lands on a number of how many tickets you've one. With the writing, I pressed a button and it would play carnival music before revealing the story. What makes it digital in my opinion is the interactivness and how the lines of the story loaded themselves instead of just being there for me to scroll down myself.

- A personal response (whether you liked it, how it made you feel, etc)

I enjoyed clicking 'new story' to see what would be there next and it did come across to me like a game so it was fun too. The stories themselves were interesting because - from what I read - all the characters were labelled by their career, I didn't see any real names. The stories themselves didn't make much sense to me either but it was cool to see how they were being told.

Still Standing (Bruno Nadeau and Jason Lewis)
- What makes the work a piece of digital writing?

This piece is also interactive, in fact, you can't read it without interacting with it. This piece involves a heap of letters on a projector that act like magnets, following whoever is standing in front of it. It is only when they remain still that the letters form a poem. Given this is interactive and digitally created, it's digital writing.

- A personal response (whether you liked it, how it made you feel, etc)

I thought it was cool how the letters take shape of the person standing in front of them to form the poem and how you have to be still to read it. In the introductory paragraph the creators mentioned art and the fast pace at which it is observed. This piece basically forces you to stop and truly observe it to see it all and I think that's cool.
